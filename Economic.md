# 🌐 **TokenizeLocal**  
## **Tokenization of Small Businesses with Automated Dividend Payouts**
### 🔍 1. Problem
Small and medium-sized businesses face a number of challenges:
| Problem | Description |
|--------|----------|
| Lack of investment | Banks are reluctant to lend, and funds often ignore small projects. |
| Share liquidity | Investors find it difficult to exit or sell their stake. |
| Trust in data | Financial statements are often inaccessible or opaque. |
| Profit distribution | No mechanism exists for automatically distributing profits among investors. |
---
### 💡 2. Solution
**TokenizeLocal** is a platform for tokenizing business shares through a centralized system based on a database. It enables:
- Businesses to issue tokens tied to a share of their revenue.
- Investors to purchase tokens and receive **monthly dividends**.
- The platform to evolve from a simple database to a full blockchain ecosystem.
---
### 📈 3. How It Works?
#### For a business:
1. **Registration by INN** → Company status is verified via Checko API.
2. **Token issuance** → The number of tokens and the percentage of revenue to be distributed are determined.
3. **Updating revenue data** → Revenue information is submitted to the system.
4. **Automated dividend distribution** → Funds are distributed among all token holders.
#### For a user / investor:
1. **Registration/authentication** → Email + password.
2. **Select a business** → View available companies and token quantities.
3. **Purchase tokens** → User receives tokens.
4. **Monthly dividends** → Payouts proportional to the number of tokens held.
---
### 🧩 4. Project Structure
Initially, the system is built on a centralized database (`SQLite`) with future scalability in mind:
- **blockchain/db_manager.py** — Manages businesses, tokens, and user balances.
- **verification/api_client.py** — Verifies company status via Checko API.
- **utils/logger.py** — Logs system events.
- **main.py** — Entry point, implements all business logic.
- **blockchain/users.py** — Handles user registration and authentication.
- **blockchain/register_user.py** — Standalone registration script.
- **blockchain/records_check.py** — Checks database contents.
---
### 📁 5. Database Tables
| Table | Description |
|--------|----------|
| `businesses` | Stores INN and company name |
| `token_issuances` | Number of issued tokens |
| `users` | Email, name, password |
| `user_tokens` | Token balance for each user |
| `dividend_history` *(optional)* | Dividend payment history |
---
### 💰 6. Dividend Calculation Mechanism
Each month, the system:
1. Retrieves the business’s revenue (e.g., from financial reports).
2. Sets the dividend amount (e.g., 10% of revenue).
3. Distributes funds proportionally based on the number of tokens held by each user.
#### Example:
- Total number of tokens: **10,000**
- Business revenue: **$10,000**
- Dividend percentage: **10%**
- Total dividend pool: **$1,000**
👉 A user with 200 tokens receives:  
**$1,000 × (200 / 10,000) = $20**
---
### 📊 7. Economic Model
#### Token Price
Determined by company revenue and the number of tokens issued.  
Example:  
- Company earns $10,000 in monthly revenue.
- Allocates 10% → $1,000 for dividends.
- Issues 10,000 tokens → **1 token = $0.1 per month**.
#### ROI (Return on Investment)
If an investor buys 1,000 tokens for $100 → receives $10/month → **ROI ~10% per month**.
---
### 🔄 8. Secondary Token Market
Currently, tokens are recorded in the database, but resale functionality is already designed.  
In the future, an internal DEX can be launched where:
- Token prices are determined by supply and demand.
- Users can trade tokens directly.
- Prices depend on business growth and revenue.
---
### 📉 9. What Affects Token Price?
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|----------|
| Revenue growth | ➕ Tokens increase in value |
| Extended dividend period | ➕ Higher overall value |
| Increased revenue percentage | ➕ Higher dividends |
| Revenue decline | ➖ Tokens lose value |
| Business liquidation | ❌ Tokens become worthless |
---
